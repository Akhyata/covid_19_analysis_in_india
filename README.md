- **Data Analysis**: Utilized Pandas for data manipulation, including merging and filtering datasets.
  
- **Insights Generation**: Used SQL to calculate Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) such as infection rates, recovery rates, and mortality rates.
- here we use some sql function like
  - Aggregate Functions
  - CTE 
  - windows function
